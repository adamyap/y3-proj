Detect the movement of a brightly colored ball in a labyrinth using Python and OpenCV.

    - Uses a video camera recording with a brightly colored ball.
    - Define the location of the ball relative to the labyrinth.
    - Use OpenCV to load the video capture and apply detection algorithms
        - Apply color thresholding to extract the ball.
        - Find contours to isolate the ball.
    - Do BIG MATH to figure out ball movement.
    - Apply path-finding algorithms to find the best path through the labyrinth.
    - Display everything on PC.
        - Highlight the ball location.
        - Display projected path.

LIBRARIES NEEDED (atm)
    - Python
    - OpenCV
    - NumPy
    - more will likely be added in the future.
